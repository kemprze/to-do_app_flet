# to-do_app_flet

Some time ago I decided to learn to use Flet, so, as I had many issues with other to-do apps, I chose a To-Do app as my first project. This is why my code may look a bit chaotic and very against the conventions that are usually implemented by other programmists. Sorry about that, I am kinda improvising.

At the current moment added:
  [+] home screen that lists the tasks in a singular list view <br>
  [+] 'add new task' screen linked to a floating action button <br>
  [+] 'remove task' button along with a required function <br>
  [+] ability to store tasks in a dictionary saved to a CSV file (along with a necessary function) <br>
<br>
<br>
Planned features:
  > task categories (e.g. time-sensitive, important, done) <br>
  > integration with Google Tasks, iCloud (still figuring this one out) <br>
  > 'edit task' screen to change the already existing ones <br>
  > ability to 'cross out tasks' with the use of a checkbox (connected to task categories) <br>
  > state handling for iOS and Android
